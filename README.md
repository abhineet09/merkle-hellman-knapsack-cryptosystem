# Part 1: Building a LinkedList Class

Key skills demonstrated include:

Recursive Programming: Adding methods like listCopy_rec() and listLength_rec() for recursive copying and length calculation of the list.<br>
Custom Methods: Creating methods such as displayEveryThird() and a custom toString() for enhanced functionality.<br>
Big Theta Notation: Commenting on methods with runtime complexity in Big Theta notation, ensuring performance analysis.<br>
Comprehensive Testing: Writing a main routine to rigorously test the linked list functionality, including node creation, copying, and iteration.

# Part 2: Implementing Merkle-Hellman Knapsack Cryptosystem

Leveraging the linked list from Part 1, it implements a Merkle-Hellman Knapsack Cryptosystem. Skills utilized include:

Cryptographic Key Management: Generating, encrypting, and decrypting keys using the linked list to hold sequences of Java BigIntegers.<br>
BigInteger Operations: Using Javaâ€™s BigInteger class to handle large integer arithmetic essential for cryptographic processes.<br>
Interactive Applications: Developing an interactive console application for user input and real-time encryption/decryption, demonstrating practical application of theoretical cryptographic principles.

# Part 3: Building a Merkle Tree

In the final part, a Merkle Tree using the custom linked list is developed to manage nodes and hash values. This involves:

Tree Structures: Constructing a tree of hashes and computing the Merkle root from text file inputs.<br>
Hash Functions: Utilizing SHA-256 for cryptographic hashing, ensuring data integrity and security.<br>
File Handling and User Interaction: Reading from files, handling UTF-8 text, and managing user prompts to dynamically build and display the Merkle Tree.

# Key Learnings

Enhanced Understanding of Data Structures: Deepened knowledge of linked lists and their applications in cryptography and tree structures.<br>
Practical Cryptography: Gained hands-on experience with the Merkle-Hellman Knapsack Cryptosystem and Merkle Trees.<br>
Performance and Efficiency: Emphasized efficient coding practices and performance analysis through Big Theta notation and optimized algorithms.<br>

This comprehensive project not only reinforces foundational data structures and algorithms but also integrates them with advanced cryptographic techniques, providing a robust learning experience in both theoretical and practical aspects of computer science.
